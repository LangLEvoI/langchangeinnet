# Language Change in Social Networks
Modelling language change in social networks in Python

*Updated: 20190506*

## Summary
In this project, it would be divided into two parts. In the first part, a computational model which was proposed in the study of [Fagyal, Swarup, Escobar, Gasser, & Lakkaraju (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384110000203) would be replicated in pure Python. Their study mainly aims to investigate the dynamics of language change in different social networks using [agent-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). In the second part, I would attempt to extend this original model, such as testing it with a real-world network.
